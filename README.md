# .url WebView Opener

> A lightweight and minimalist Obsidian plugin to view, open, and edit `.url` files directly in Obsidian’s native webview. Perfect for users who want to keep web documents or webapps accessible inside Obsidian, while standard links still open in your browser. If you simply want all links to open in a webview, use the Webview Core Plugin instead.

## Installation

### From Obsidian (easiest)

Install the plugin from the [Community plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=.url%20webview%20opener) section in the app settings.

### From git

Clone the plugin in your `.obsidian/plugins` directory:

```shell
cd /path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugins
git clone https://github.com/Kieirra/obsidian-url-extension.git
```

### From source

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kieirra/obsidian-url-extension/releases) and unzip it in the `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-url-extension` directory.

## Usage

### Create URL file

You can create a `.url` file in three ways:
- Ribbon icon (left bar)
- Command palette: “Create .url file”
- Folder context menu (right-click a folder) → "Create .url file"

Location rules:
- If a folder is selected in the file explorer: the file is created inside that folder.
- Else if a file is selected: the file is created next to that file (same folder).
- Else: the file is created in the parent folder of the active file; if none, at the vault root.

Newly created `.url` files open directly in edit mode.

You can write either a plain URL:
```
https://example.com
```

Or Windows format:
```
[InternetShortcut]
URL=https://example.com
```

### View and Edit

- Click your `.url` file to open it in the Obsidian webview.
- Use the edit button (top right) to modify the URL.
- Use the open in browser button (top right) to launch the link in your default browser.

Note: When a `.url` file is created via the plugin, edit mode takes precedence over “Open in browser by default” for that first open.

### Automatic URL normalization

If you type a URL without a scheme (e.g. `www.google.com`), the plugin automatically prepends `https://` when opening the link (`https://www.google.com`). If you include a scheme (`http://`, `https://`, etc.), it is respected as-is.

### Features

Configure in Settings > Community plugins > `.url WebView Opener`:

- **Open in browser by default**: Automatically opens the link in your default browser when you click a `.url` file.
- **Fullscreen mode**: Displays the webview in fullscreen for a more immersive experience, hiding the header bar. You can toggle the header bar back by clicking the chevron icon.
