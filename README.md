# .url WebView Opener

> A lightweight and minimalist Obsidian plugin to view, open, and edit `.url` files directly in Obsidianâ€™s native webview. Perfect for users who want to keep web documents or webapps accessible inside Obsidian, while standard links still open in your browser. If you simply want all links to open in a webview, use the Webview Core Plugin instead.
